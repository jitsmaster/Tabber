# Tabber Extension Specification

## Overview

Tabber is a VS Code extension that converts space indentation to tab indentation while providing standard formatting capabilities. This project contains comprehensive specifications for the extension's design and implementation.

## Specification Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Requirements](requirements.md) | Core requirements and functionality |
| [Algorithm](algorithm.md) | Detailed pseudocode for core conversion algorithms |
| [Extension Structure](extension-structure.md) | Commands, APIs, and configuration schema |
| [File Types & Edge Cases](file-types-and-edge-cases.md) | Language-specific handling and edge cases |
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | Component architecture and implementation roadmap |
| [Testing Guide](testing-guide.md) | Test cases and quality assurance strategy |

## Key Features

- Convert space-based indentation to tab-based (4-space tabs by default)
- Format documents according to standard rules
- Preserve code structure and special content during conversion
- Activate via command palette or keyboard shortcuts
- Configure tab size and conversion behavior
- Support various programming languages with language-specific handling
- Provide status notifications and indentation analysis

## Implementation Approach

The extension follows a modular architecture with these core components:

1. **Command Handling** - Process user commands
2. **Indentation Detection** - Analyze document indentation patterns
3. **Conversion Engine** - Transform spaces to tabs
4. **Content Preservation** - Protect string literals, comments, etc.
5. **Configuration Service** - Manage user settings
6. **Status Reporting** - Provide user feedback and notifications

## Next Steps

1. Set up extension project structure
2. Implement core indentation detection algorithm
3. Develop space-to-tab conversion engine
4. Add content preservation logic
5. Implement VS Code integration
6. Add language-specific handling
7. Create user interface components
8. Implement comprehensive test cases
