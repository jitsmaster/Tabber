# Tabber Extension Requirements

## Overview
Tabber is a VS Code extension designed to convert space-based indentation to tab-based indentation while also providing standard formatting capabilities. This document outlines the core requirements and functionality of the extension.

## Core Requirements

1. **Space to Tab Conversion**
   - Convert all indentation from spaces to tabs
   - Default tab size will be 4 spaces
   - Maintain code structure and alignment during conversion
   - Handle mixed indentation scenarios

2. **Document Formatting**
   - Format documents according to standard formatting rules
   - Preserve user's existing formatting preferences where applicable
   - Support various programming languages and file types

3. **Activation Methods**
   - Command palette activation via dedicated commands
   - Keyboard shortcut activation for quick access
   - Optional context menu integration

4. **Configuration**
   - Allow users to configure tab size (default: 4 spaces)
   - Enable/disable automatic formatting on save
   - Specify file types to include/exclude
   - Configure language-specific behaviors

5. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear status notifications during conversion process
   - Display error messages for conversion failures
   - Show statistics on conversions (spaces replaced, lines modified)
   - Minimal performance impact on large files

6. **Integration**
   - Seamless integration with VS Code's existing formatting capabilities
   - Non-interference with other formatting extensions when specified
   - Respect VS Code's language-specific formatting settings

## Success Criteria

1. Accurately converts space indentation to tabs without disrupting code structure
2. Maintains compatibility with VS Code's native formatting capabilities
3. Provides a smooth, intuitive user experience
4. Handles diverse file types and programming languages appropriately
5. Processes large files efficiently without significant performance degradation
